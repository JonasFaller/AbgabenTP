						<img src="images/sixoutoften.jpg" alt="HTML5 Icon" width="130" height="128">
						<p>Overall, I would rate this book a six out of ten because the book kept you wondering what was going to happen next. 
						Some parts of the book got boring, because there wasn´t much going on. Another reason I gave the book a 6 out of 10 is because a lot of the time the scene would just all of a sudden change and new characters that were never introduced before. They just came into the story which made the story hard to follow. I would recommend this book for ages 14-18.
